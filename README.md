# A dump for my small projects.
No promises that any of these work, will remain working, or have even been implemented. Feel free to fork!

## Mandelbrot
A basic mandelbrot fractal rendering system. Works OK but has issues at close zoom levels probably caused by floating point accuracy or something although I have not investigated. If I revisit this I will probably program the new version from scratch in hopes of avoiding this issue. I will (probably) not work on this further.
## AutomataVideoGenerator
A simple system for rendering basic 2D cellular automatons, not worked on in a while so no guaruntees of stability, the UI did work to some extent though
## UrbDevSim
Undeveloped

~~## Critters~~
~~This is one of the more developed projects in this repository that simulates evolution through simple agents - I was also trying a new rendering framework for this. Works well and should be stable as of writing!~~
Moved to its own repo! I want to keep this stable.

~~## EvoSim~~
This became critters

~~## GOL~~
Made redundant by AutomataVideoGenerator

~~## ShaderRenderer~~
~~## Slime-Mould-Sim~~
Very old - abandoned for now
